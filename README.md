# .NET library for Lono

Lono is an internet-of-things connected sprinkler controller and one of the first outdoor 
smart home companies.  They can be found at [@lono-devices](//github.com/lono-devices).

This library is used to interface with Lono's public API. For more information, you can take
a look at their [documentation](http://make.lono.io/docs).

## Installation

I plan to add this to NuGet in the future. For now, download Visual Studio 2015, fetch the repo
and build. You can then include the LonoNet library within your .NET application.
